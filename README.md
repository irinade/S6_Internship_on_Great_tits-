# S6 Internship : A PHYLOGENETIC AND ECOLOGICAL STUDY OF SONGBIRDS EVOLUTIONARY DIVERGENCE:-

Here you will find my internship report and presentation for my 2 two months internship (4 months in total) on the phylogenetic and ecological study of songbird evolutionary divergence. 

The program I used to assess the influence of maternal effects and habitat quality on reproductive success of Great tits is also present in the files!

My R notebook and his HTML counterpart with the program, the results, and the analysis are available in this repository. However, the dataset I used is not public and no present here.
